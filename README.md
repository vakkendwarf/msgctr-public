Automated bot to count fb messenger messages.

A fair warning: This is a (mostly) private project. If you're not fluent in JS, you will not be able to use it.
It requires manual generation of google sheets credentials, and manual insertion of certain info like convo ID and sheet ID into the js script yourself.
